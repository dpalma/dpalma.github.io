This project uses the VEX &quot;TouchLED&quot; sensor and a [ModKit for VEX](https://www.modkit.com/vex/editor)
program to implement a simple siren.
This activity is intended for elementary-aged kids to complete in a one hour session.
<!--more--> It was developed for the robotics club at the Barbieri Elementary School in Framingham, MA.

Kids love using noise and light features.
I like that the project includes loops and a &quot;break&quot;, which can be hard to
find a use for in a maze-challenge robot.
If you try it out, let me know how it goes in the comments.
