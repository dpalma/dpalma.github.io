title: Building a siren with VEX ModKit

Our elementary school robotics club switched from Lego Mindstorms to VEX this year.
I&apos;ve been experimenting with the associated [ModKit for VEX](https://www.modkit.com/vex/editor) software for my own benefit.
This project uses the kit&apos;s &quot;TouchLED&quot; sensor to implement a simple siren.

I haven&apos;t actually run this activity myself yet, but I think it&apos;s about the right length and complexity
for elementary-aged kids in a one hour session. Kids love using noise and light features.
I like that the project includes loops and a &quot;break&quot;, which can be hard to
find a use for in a maze-challenge robot.
If you try it out, let me know how it goes in the comments.
